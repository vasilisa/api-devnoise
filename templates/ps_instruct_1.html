<div class="instruct" id="main">
  <br>
  <p>You will see a star in the middle of the screen surrounded by a ring that has a space bucket on it.</p>
  <div id="ps_instruct_1"></div>

  <p>Your task is to catch the asteroids flying from the star by moving the bucket around the space ring. Before each time the asteroid flies out, you can choose a new location for your bucket.</p>

  <p>So, you need to predict where the next asteroid piece will land. If the asteroid lands on the bucket, you <strong style="color:white;">win</strong> points. But if it doesnâ€™t, you <strong style="color:white;">lose</strong> points.

  <p>Usually the asteroid lands in <strong>about the same location, but sometimes this will change!</strong></p>
