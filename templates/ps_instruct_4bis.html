<p>Let's have a practice!</p> 

<p>You will see how many points you've collected along the way.</p>
<p>Each time you catch an asteroid you will <strong style="color:white;">win</strong> points. Each time you miss it, you will <strong style="color:white;">loose</strong> points. 

<br>
<p>After, you will have to <strong style="color:white;">complete a short quiz</strong> relating to the game.</p>

<p>You will need to answer <strong style="color:white;">all of the quiz questions correctly</strong> to move on in the game - otherwise we will bring you through the instructions and practice again.</p>
<p>So, please, pay attention!</p>
